# Circular Reference

Circular references occur when two or more objects hold references to each other, creating a cycle in memory. This can lead to memory leaks, especially in the context of smart pointers like `std::shared_ptr`, as the reference count will never reach zero.

## How Circular References Occur

In C++, circular references typically happen when:

1. **Shared Ownership**: Two or more `std::shared_ptr` instances reference each other.
2. **Mutual References**: Objects are designed to refer back to one another, leading to a situation where neither can be destructed.

### Example of Circular Reference

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>

struct Node {
    std::shared_ptr<Node> next;
    std::shared_ptr<Node> prev; // Circular reference
};

void createCircularReference() {
    auto node1 = std::make_shared<Node>();
    auto node2 = std::make_shared<Node>();
    
    node1->next = node2;
    node2->prev = node1; // Creates a circular reference

    // Both nodes will never be destroyed, leading to a memory leak
}
```

## Problems Caused by Circular References

- **Memory Leaks**: Since the reference count of the involved objects never reaches zero, memory allocated for these objects is not freed, leading to leaks.
- **Increased Complexity**: Managing lifetimes and ownership becomes more complicated when circular references are present.

## Breaking Circular References with `std::weak_ptr`

To prevent circular references, you can use [[1. Fundamentals of Programming/Memory Management/weak_ptr|weak_ptr]]. This smart pointer provides a non-owning reference that does not affect the reference count of the [[1. Fundamentals of programming/Memory Management/shared_ptr|shared_ptr]].

### Solution Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>

struct Node {
    std::shared_ptr<Node> next;
    std::weak_ptr<Node> prev; // Use weak_ptr to break the cycle
};

void createNonCircularReference() {
    auto node1 = std::make_shared<Node>();
    auto node2 = std::make_shared<Node>();

    node1->next = node2;
    node2->prev = node1; // No circular reference, prevents memory leak
}
```

## Conclusion

Circular references can lead to significant memory management issues in C++. Utilizing `std::weak_ptr` effectively helps break these cycles, ensuring proper resource management and preventing memory leaks in complex object relationships. Understanding how to handle circular references is essential for robust C++ programming.
