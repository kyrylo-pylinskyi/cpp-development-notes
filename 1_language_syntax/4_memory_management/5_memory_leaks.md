# Memory Leaks

A memory leak occurs when a program allocates memory dynamically but fails to release it after use. This can lead to increased memory consumption and, ultimately, system instability or application crashes.

## Key Features of Memory Leaks

### 1. Definition

A memory leak happens when:
- Memory is allocated using `new` or similar functions.
- The allocated memory is not deallocated with `delete`, resulting in a loss of reference to that memory.

### 2. Causes of Memory Leaks

Common causes include:

- **Forgetting to Delete**: Failing to call `delete` after `new` or `delete[]` after `new[]`.

  ```cpp
  int* ptr = new int(42);
  // Missing delete ptr; leads to a memory leak
  ```

- **Exceptions**: Throwing exceptions without proper cleanup can also cause leaks if memory allocation occurs in a try block.

  ```cpp
  try {
      int* ptr = new int(42);
      throw std::runtime_error("Error");
  } catch (...) {
      // ptr is leaked
  }
  ```

- **Circular References**: Using `std::shared_ptr` incorrectly can lead to [[10_circular_reference|circular references]], preventing the reference count from reaching zero.

### 3. Symptoms of Memory Leaks

- **Increased Memory Usage**: Continuous allocation without release leads to higher memory consumption.
- **Performance Degradation**: Applications may slow down as memory usage increases.
- **Application Crashes**: Eventually, the system may run out of memory, causing crashes.

### 4. Detection and Prevention

#### Tools for Detection

- **Memory Leak Detection Tools**: Tools like Valgrind, AddressSanitizer, or built-in tools in IDEs can help detect memory leaks.
- **Static Analysis Tools**: Analyzers like Clang-Tidy or CPPCheck can find potential memory leak issues in code.

#### Best Practices to Prevent Memory Leaks

- **Use Smart Pointers**: Prefer `std::unique_ptr` and `std::shared_ptr` over raw pointers for automatic memory management.

  ```cpp
  std::unique_ptr<int> ptr = std::make_unique<int>(42); // Automatically managed
  ```

- **Follow RAII Principles**: Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) ensures that resources are tied to object lifetimes, automatically releasing them when objects go out of scope.

- **Consistent Deallocation**: Always ensure that every `new` has a corresponding `delete`, and every `new[]` has a corresponding `delete[]`.

### 5. Example of a Memory Leak

Hereâ€™s an example illustrating a memory leak:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void memoryLeakExample() {
    int* ptr = new int(42); // Memory allocated
    // No delete, leads to a memory leak
}

int main() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {
        memoryLeakExample(); // Each call leaks memory
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## Conclusion

Memory leaks are a significant concern in C++ programming, leading to resource exhaustion and application instability. By following best practices, using smart pointers, and utilizing tools for detection, developers can effectively manage memory and prevent leaks in their applications. Understanding memory management is crucial for writing robust and efficient C++ code.
